Add support to build and run this on Windows.

Fix / add the ability to run this server locally on the
same PC that runs the HPSDR client program. Not sure
if its possible to connect from the same client port to
the same server (address and port).

The Alsa local sound routines may need some work. Every now
and then the audio skips and is caused by xruns.

Validate and perhaps better optimize the down sampling routines.

It may be useful to stagger multiple 'real' RTL rcvrs when making
'copy' rcvrs instead of just making multiple copies of the last.

Maybe do something with the Wideband view?

Add preamp and attenuator functionality?

No testing has been done on this program's behavior with other
HPSDR equipment in the network.
